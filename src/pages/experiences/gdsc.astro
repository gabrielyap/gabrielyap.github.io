                While attending UC Davis, I joined the Google Developer Student
                Club to gain experience in the software development life cycle,
                as well as the priceless experience of working together in a
                team. With a small scrum team, we built a full-stack chat app
                using Google Firebase as the main technology.

                     After I passed the cohort interviews, I joined a team to
                    make a total of five developers. We all were interested in
                    web development, so we decided we wanted to make a fullstack
                    chat app that uses Google Firebase as the main backend and
                    website hosting service. Since it was all of our first times
                    working on a software project as a team, with no concrete
                    goals/deadlines like in classes, we had to learn many things
                    together. These include version control, task delegation,
                    Agile Methodologies, and more. My main role was to develop
                    and stylize the frontend by using
                    <span class="font-semibold">React</span>. I used hooks and
                    made components to construct the website architecture, and
                    used CSS for responsiveness. At the end of the quarter, we
                    presented our project to a lecture hall of 120+ students and
                    aspiring developers.
                    <br /><br />
                     Through my activity in the club, I learned a lot about the
                    challenges one may face while working in a team. Things
                    might not always go as planned, and a team must be able to
                    adapt. However, I believe that the feeling of accomplishment
                    that comes with completing a group project makes it all
                    worth it. After all the time spent brainstorming,
                    developing, preparing, and presenting, it feels great to
                    know that we, a group of undergrads who were complete
                    strangers, can output a product if we were committed enough.
                    It was truly an honor to work with my peers.
