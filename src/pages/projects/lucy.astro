                A Roguelite with procedurally generated rooms. To start, the
                player will pick between a melee knight or a ranged sorceress,
                then walk into the castle. Theyâ€™ll battle their way through
                several procedurally generated rooms, fighting enemies until
                they make their way to the end room. Once they've reached the
                end room or have died, the player can use the coins they've
                accumulated throughout the run to upgrade their health, speed,
                or attack damage. Although the player's progress in these rooms
                will be reset upon exit, the players will retain their stats
                throughout death, which provides incentive for longer play
                sessions, even after the player dies.
