                A Roguelite with procedurally generated rooms. To start, the
                player will pick between a melee knight or a ranged sorceress,
                then walk into the castle. Theyâ€™ll battle their way through
                several procedurally generated rooms, fighting enemies until
                they make their way to the end room. Once they've reached the
                end room or have died, the player can use the coins they've
                accumulated throughout the run to upgrade their health, speed,
                or attack damage. Although the player's progress in these rooms
                will be reset upon exit, the players will retain their stats
                throughout death, which provides incentive for longer play
                sessions, even after the player dies.

                    <div class="font-bold">User Interface</div>
                     Most of my prior experiences and projects have been more
                    logical work, whether it's developing a backend or a
                    frontend. Seeking the opportunity to try something new, I
                    volunteered to take on the User Interface responsibility for
                    the team. The first thing I worked on was our basic Health
                    UI and Player Health logic and our SP gauge and pickups. The
                    health later got put into a combined script with the
                    players' stats and we had to scrap our SP and special moves
                    idea due to time, so they are no longer in the main code. I
                    also made the Main Menu, Death Screen, and Pause Menu. These
                    additions were all complete with working buttons that either
                    change the scene or use a script to add or remove components
                    in the Unity Canvas. <br /><br />
                    <div class="font-bold">Press Kit and Trailer</div>
                     Staying on theme with user perception, I also took on the
                    responsibility of producing the trailer and making the press
                    kit. One thing I kept in mind while making the presskit was
                    that I wanted it to be on a website where users can look at
                    the game's screenshots, the trailer, and descriptions of the
                    game all in one area. I decided to use itch.io since it met
                    all of these requirements, while also being easy to set up.
                    For the trailer, I used OBS to record all of the clips, and
                    Microsoft ClipChamp to edit it all together. In the trailer,
                    I wanted to show all of the important features of our game
                    including combat, gold pickups, purchasing upgrades, the two
                    classes, and I finally wanted to show that the dungeon is
                    big and different every time. I explicitly recorded
                    fast-paced clips that captured the difficulty and fast
                    mechanics one must have to beat a room (at least as a
                    knight). Similarly, I chose the screenshots for the same
                    reason. I wanted to show off combat, the prerun area, and
                    the shop GUI.
